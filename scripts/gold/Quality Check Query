select column_name
from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'silver' and table_name = 'crm_cust_info';

select column_name from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns

1. Aggregation: get data for gender from crm and after in erp and save them
as gender
2. Changing the names came from other tables to new and more usndrstandble name
3. Some repositiones for columns counrtry after last_name and birthdate before
create date.
4.1. for this table and as we can see all are dimention we need a primary key rather than the one
is alreasy existed from other tables.
4.2. "Surrogate Key" which is the System_generated unique identifier assigned to each record in a tabel
5. All object in gold layer are view
======================================
select COLUMN_NAME
from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
where table_schema = 'silver' and table_name = 'crm_prd_info'
----------------
1. To find the correct information in this table is good to go with end date(prd_end_dt)
 which is refare to the time ans as it is NULL means they are still active and good to have
 "" Filtering out all historical data ""
 also we can remove the prd_end_dt >> all of them NULL
2. joining silver.crm_prd_info with erp_px_g1v2 (Category table). join with cat_id
3. Checking for quality of data with subquery.. Expectation >> NO Result >> GOOD. frist two left join
4. Checking for duplicated colouns (are the same info) >>> Nothing Found >> GOOD>
5. Columns order by relative names prd_id, cat_id ...............
6. Making understandble names for each columns 
7. Making Primary Key "Surrogate Key".
8. Creating View
===============================
select column_name
from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'silver' and TABLE_NAME = 'crm_sales_details'
--------------------------------------------
1. We are going to first switch sls_prd_key and sls_cust_id to surrogate keys which created
for new gold views and use them >> Data Lookup joining tables just toget this information.
2. Left join with gold.dim_products and gold.dim_customer and added product_key and customer_key
 rather than sls_prd_key, sls_cust_id.
3. Name columns to new understandable names.
4. make sure they are in group order like >> Dimension keys[order_number, product_key, customer_ke]
 dates[order_date, shipping_date, due_date], Measures[sales_amount, quntity, price].
5. Creating the view
